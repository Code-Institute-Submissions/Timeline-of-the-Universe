# Universalis Extraordinaire - The Universal Timeline

This is a front end only website built as the Stream 1 Project of The Code Institute's classroom bootcamp. It's an interactive timeline displaying the history of the universe, from the Big-Bang to the appearance of the first flowers, and beyond!


## Live Demo

Here is the link for the Heroku-deployed website https://crisperdarkling.github.io/Timeline-of-the-Universe/


## Components

This website uses the plugin Timeline.js to render the interactive timeline (http://timeline.knightlab.com/).

The timeline information (timepoint, headline, text, media, thumbnail etc) is entered into a template Google Spreadsheet which then gets published and inserted into my html pages via iframe embed link.

## Deployment

This project was deployed via GitHub Pages.


## Versioning

The code was written on Cloud9 and version-controlled using github https://github.com/CrisperDarkling/Timeline-of-the-Universe


## Project Management

I used the Asana website and app to manage my project tasks from beginning to end. I had multiple column headings under which I could easily create, alter and move tasks around.


My tasks:

## The Age of Man Section

This section is still under construction. I will continue building it once Code Institute grades have been given.
